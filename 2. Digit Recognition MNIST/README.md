# Neural-Network -> Training a net to recognize handwritten digits using MNIST training date


 Functions explained:


 Version 1 ( 31st August 2015) [ training done on a batch of 100 with 500 epochs]

 Shortcomings in this version:

 -7 it always displays 2
 -9 it displays 2,3
 -1 if displays 1 only if the line drawn is in the center, other wise it oftern shows 8 or 3
 -4 if displays correctly only if 4 is written towards the upper right of the 28x28 matrix
 -8,5,2,0 are shown correct if legible



 References : After first trial, the net is unable to recognise 7 and 9 if you make an image in photoshop and try to make it read.
